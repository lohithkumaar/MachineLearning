Machine Learning Regression Models
This repository contains examples of various regression models implemented using popular machine learning libraries. Regression models are widely used in machine learning and data analysis for predicting continuous numerical values based on input features.

Models Included
The following regression models are included in this repository:

Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Neural Network Regression
Each model is implemented using different libraries and frameworks, allowing you to compare their performance and understand their usage in different contexts.

Installation
To run the examples in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following dependencies:

  numpy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  matplotlib
  tensorflow (for neural network regression)
You can install the dependencies using pip with the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Each regression model is implemented as a separate Python script. You can find the example scripts in the examples directory. Simply run the desired script to execute the corresponding regression model. The examples are accompanied by detailed comments to help you understand the code and modify it as needed.

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the dataset required for each model. The datasets are included in the data directory. If a script requires a specific dataset, it will be mentioned in the corresponding script's comments.
